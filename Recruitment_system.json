Wat weten we wel en wat weten we eigenlijk allemaal niet?Het concept van de opstelling won een prijs. Samen met een studiegenoot heb ik de mogelijkheid gekregen om de opstelling daadwerkelijk te bouwen op groots wetenschapsfestival in Groningen. We hebben er een mooie avond en een haast nog mooier cijfer (9,5) aan over gehouden.In de link is de film te zien die tijdens de opleiding is gemaakt en ook een plek kreeg in de opstelling.",

In addition to being the requirement engineer she has also led planning sessions, backlog alignment and feature walkthroughs. She has been the go-to person for the development team whenever a detailed decision needs to be taken and she leads the scheduling for UX creation. In all of her assignments she has done an excellent job. Amanda has no problem going outside her comfort zone. She engages in the topics, follows up on commitments, and is a great teamplayer. I would give her my best recommendations ”",

Very open and direct, if there is anything that is unclear or she does not agree to, she speak her mind. She has a good relation to her teams, and is a positive and respected colleague. I would highly recommend Amanda, it is a joy having worked with her and whoever gets her as a colleague, lucky you!”"

The Swedish and Japanese websites of two companies established in both Japan and Sweden, IKEA and DAIKIN, have been analyzed based on a model devised by Würtz (2006) in a previous study of the same topic. This model is in turn based on Hall and Hofstede’s theories on cultural differences and differences between so-called low-context cultures (e.g. Sweden) and high-context cultures (e.g. Japan). The model focuses on the use of animation, promotion of cultural values such as masculinity/femininity and individualism/collectivism, individuals being depicted together with products or not, level of transparency in the web design and finally linear vs. parallel navigation on the websites. Besides the study of the websites two interviews were held with a designer/developer from each company to get further input into how the companies think about their web design.",

Current control strategy of the system is simple feedback control system with one PID controller. Results of current control strategy were taken into account for improvements in terms of system stability, valve movements and unwanted transients. Problems found in condensate system were; large variations in process variable, extra movement in valve positions and inefficient opening of valves. Simulation model with current control strategy and results as of real power plant was created and validated, as new control strategy can be applied and results can be compared. The main recommendation to improve the control system performance was found through PID cascade control strategy that could assist the current controller. The recommendation was evaluated by designing and implementing the cascade control strategy on the Dymola simulation model. Simulation results pointed out considerable increase in system performance according to the requirements of Ringhals (Vattenfall) AB Sweden.",

Studien har också kritiskt granskat de problem och svårigheter som kan komma att uppstå. Undersökningen har gjorts med hjälp av en litteraturstudie samt en utveckling av en Proof-of-Concept-modell för att simulera ett sådant system och för att kunna göra beräkningar och undersökningar av och inom ett sådant. Undersökningen har visat att Azure Service Bus matchar de krav och önskemål som på förhand ställts, samt visat på hur säker kommunikation kan garanteras med hjälp av denna servicebuss. Undersökningen avslutas med en analys av studien som helhet och resultatet i synnerhet, samt föreslår åtgärder vid vidare forskning inom ämnet. Avslutningsvis lämnas rekommendationer på hur uppdragsgivaren ska gå tillväga baserat på vad som i studien framkommer.",

An audio controller outputs an intermediate audio signal having a predefined test segment comprising a predefined test frequency component. An audio synthesis stage provides, based on the intermediate audio signal, an output audio signal for use in audio playback. An audio test is performed based on a first segment of the output audio signal corresponding to the test segment of the intermediate audio signal, and a safety processor declares correct the operation of the audio synthesis stage in case the result of the audio test is positive. The safety processor declares correct the operation of a frequency monitor if both the frequency monitor and a frequency-selective audio sensor detect the test frequency in the first segment of the output audio signal.",

        "description": "Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a trending topic in recent different research domains. This type of communication is very promising in dealing with cellular traffic offloading and energy efficiency. However, how multi-hop D2D communication between devices can more significantly save power compared to B2D and how the delay and packet size impact the energy consumption are the interesting issues that we focus on. This report focuses on downlink transmission scenario, where D2D is evaluated when a user requests a content that can be transferred from another UE within its transmission range. To evaluate D2D communications, we first introduce the system model that consists of three sub-components: mobility model, community detection model, and feasible path detection model. It is important to notice that the pre-statistical data to model the user mobility is based on the social aspect of the users. By following these models step by step, we make D2D communication possible and reasonable to enable at some given constraints. Then we do power consumption comparison between D2D and B2D, and further, analyze the impact of delay and packet size in multi-hop D2D links by running simulation experiments. The findings explain that D2D communication has a better energy efficiency though it would be affected by delay and packet size. For example, a single hop D2D transmission requires 83\\% less power than a B2D transmission in a congested scenario.",

        "description": "In present days, the applications like augmented reality, language processing, pattern recognition are increasingly dependent on mobile handsets. Because of the limited computational power of mobile handsets, the response time of any application may be too long for the user experience. Mobile cloud computing is one such approach which aims to extend the battery life time of mobile handsets thereby ensuring short response time. Mobile cloud computing allows to offload the computation viawireless access point to cloud that has sufficient computational power. Most of the computations arethen performed at the cloud and the results are conveyed back to the mobile handsets. This project was focussed on the modelling the cloud offloading taking into consideration mobile stability, cloud stability and the performance of the system.",

      "Jie Yu “I had worked with Farooq for more than 7 years in the same organization, including quite a few years in the same project. During those years Farooq had demonstrated a genuine interest and strong ability of expending his competences, by taking variety of assignments, from system test, test automation in Java, network system design to lately being the scrum master of an Agile team. Every time Farooq was able to adjust to new roles quickly and become a key contributor of that area. Beside his technical skills, Farooq was also a good team leader and a team player. I found it quite easy and efficient working with him. ”",
      "Mats Bern “I was lucky to have Farooq on my team from 2014-2018. He developed greatly as a developer, tester and leader. Farooq was always willing to do the extra effort when needed and he did it with a smile. He is easygoing, flexible and technically competent. While on the team he also evolved his leadership skills, being scrum master for a design team and later a verification team. Farooq also took on the responsibility for our complete lab, keeping track of a multitude of servers and IP networks used by more than 50 people. I can give him my best recommendation in future endeavors.”"

        "description": "Abstract. Grid technologies are appealing to deal with the challenges raised by computational neurosciences and support multi-centric brain studies. However, core grids middleware hardly cope with the complex neuroimaging data representation and multi-layer data federation needs. Moreover, legacy neuroscience environments need to be preserved and cannot be simply superseded by grid services.This paper describes the NeuroLOG platform design and implementation, shedding light on its Data Management Layer. It addresses the integration of brain image ﬁles, associated relational metadata and neuroscience semantic data in a heterogeneous distributed environment, integrating legacy data managers through a mediation layer.Keywords.

      "Bettina Trapp “Yahya is a very versatile developer who can quickly come up with different solutions even for difficult tasks. But what I particularly appreciate about working with him is his fun and friendly nature, that he is always available to our QA team for questions, is not afraid to ask questions himself and independently offers screensharing sessions in which he explains his work and thus makes testing very easy for us. Due to the constant and good exchange at eye level, also with UX Designers, this enables not only an efficient, but also very pleasant cooperation in the whole software team. If you are looking for a team player who also thinks outside the box and delivers high quality even under pressure, I can only highly recommend Yahya. I would not hesitate to work with him again as a QA Engineer or Technical Writer and wish him all the best for his future.”",

Always deeply engaged in the business challenges we faced and always driving towards a great result for the business. One more fabulous experience we had with Arbisoft and the very special group of humans they have assembled! Thanks for the great time!”"

    "about": "Hi, I’m Aleksandr, a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in software craftsmanship. My career uniquely blends 6 years of backend development with 4.5 years of mastering automated testing, giving me a deep understanding of both software creation and validation.<br><br>I specialize in Distributed Backend Systems and have delivered projects with real impact in FinTech and E-commerce. For example, I built a data pipeline with Google Dataflow to index 2 million products, which led to a 15% increase in purchase conversions for a major U.S. retailer with $4.9 billion in revenue in 2024. I also improved transaction processing for a NetSuite accounting platform integration, boosting performance by 5x for large transactions on a billing system handling $2 billion annually in 2022.<br><br>Beyond technical expertise, I bring proven leadership skills, having guided teams of up to 5 engineers and driven Agile development processes. For instance, I led the ‘Search Accelerator’ project for Michaels Stores (annual revenue of $5.8 billion in 2024), successfully and timely delivering features such as Autocomplete and Facets Business Rules, which significantly enhanced search functionality and improved the overall customer experience.<br><br>My certifications in Oracle (Java), VMware (Spring), and ISTQB (Testing) reflect my commitment to quality and industry standards.<br><br>What I enjoy most about technology is the endless chance to learn and explore. I love working with new tools, tackling tough technical problems and trying out creative ideas. It’s exciting to design solutions that improve systems, whether by delivering better business results or making user experiences smoother and more enjoyable.",

      "Bohdan Ivakhiv, PMP® “It was a pleasure working with Alexander during a short but quite intensive engagement, one of the most difficult projects in my career. Despite all the challenges, Alexander was the top performer on the project. He openly communicated about risks and issues and helped to resolve them. He is a leader (even without formal position assigned) with a strong mindset who can handle any challenge, is not afraid to do things the right way, and speaks up openly. It was great working with Alexander, and I believe he will be a valuable asset to any team that values openness and engineering excellence.”",
      "Dmytro Denysiuk (He/Him) 🇺🇦 “Aleksandr's performance has been exceptional, reflecting a high level of professionalism and leadership. He has significantly contributed to the project's success by demonstrating adept management skills in task organization and efficient work distribution. His proactive approach to enhancing our development processes, particularly in developing a solution architecture, refactoring and testing, has substantially increased both the speed and quality of feature implementation. His efforts in fostering a collaborative team culture have not gone unnoticed, leading to more efficient project execution and enhanced team dynamics. Furthermore, Aleksandr's involvement in corporate activities, such as the development of a blog post and a slide deck about our Composable Commerce Kafka-centric Platform, has effectively showcased our R&D achievements to external stakeholders. Looking forward, I encourage him to continue developing his leadership skills, especially in mentoring team members. This will not only aid their professional growth but also further enhance a team's capabilities. Additionally, exploring advanced project management methodologies and deepening his technical expertise in cloud platforms and search technology will be crucial in maintaining his competitive edge and driving innovation within a team. Keep up the great work, Aleksandr. Your continuous drive for improvement and commitment to excellence is greatly appreciated and valued!”"

Rohit masters working at both the high and broader level as well as the deeper levels and he has time after time demonstrated his talent by guiding customers through often quite complex aspects of their requirements to a successful conclusion with a clear view of the broader picture. Working with Rohit on analyzing market trends is benefiting from his eye for both high and low levels. Rohit has also demonstrated his talent as a Product Owner, successfully facilitating several Agile Scrum Teams simultaneously. He is a strong contributor to our team and just gets things done.”",
      "Stephanie Erickson “I worked with Rohit for several years when I was a Product Manager at Infor. I cannot speak highly enough of working with Rohit as a Business Analyst. He was able to dive deep into very complex requirements, and document and summarize them appropriately for different audiences - designers, customers, developers, and product management. He is very skilled at facilitating requirement analysis sessions with all of these different groups. He is able to research effectively and is very detail-oriented. He is very pro-active in identifying challenges early on in the design process and working to resolve those challenges in a positive way. He also offered very helpful suggestions on how we could improve our requirements documentation process, which we successfully implemented. I hope to have the opportunity to work with Rohit again in the future, he's one of the best!”"

      "Charlotte Berg “I came across Magnus company TDialog – and was impressed with the solution that Magnus had built and successfully launched. After fruitful negotiations, Compodium International acquired TDialog in 2021. During the period of negotiations and Due Diligence I was amazed with Magnus professional, and social, capability. Magnus has the unique competence of both being a skilled programmer – and at the same time understanding the customer journey and the customer’s needs. The upcoming months we worked closely together with merging the two companies, and that was a period where I also experienced Magnus operational work. He quickly became an advisor to many of the different departments within the organization. Magnus is knowledgeable, extremely smart, humble, and easy going. Magnus is also an well-known speaker with an impressive knowledge of secure communication.”",
      "Erik Stening “ I had the pleasure working with Magnus at Compodium in both day to day operations and in more strategic discussions. Magnus has a unique ability giving clear cut insights in complex cases and is always genuine in the interest of finding the best solution to a situation. He is smart, competent and straight forward with high integrity and a great asset to any team. ”"

    "about": "After completing my studies, I made the bold decision to move from the Netherlands to Sweden. Having already studied in Sweden for 6 months, I knew my international journey wasn’t over. I wanted to gain global work experience, immerse myself in a different working culture, and explore new paths. This move wasn’t easy, but it helped me grow, adapt to new environments, and discover new passions. It shaped my independence, maturity, and how I approach challenges.\n\nWhat drives me is my passion for data and the discipline to keep pushing until I find the right path. Through careful planning and organization, I create structure for myself that enables productivity. I don’t take things at face value—I’m always looking for the \"why\" behind the process. I aim for complete, long-term solutions.\n\nI focus on creating scalable, maintainable solutions. My background as a backend software engineer taught me the importance of high data quality. This experience made me more versatile when I transitioned back into Data Science, shifting my approach from ad-hoc scripts to a structured, end-to-end mindset.\n\nI have experience in machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning, paired with a strong interest in DevOps and MLOps. I’m proficient with tools like Snowflake, AWS and Gitlab. I led a backend project supporting 500 weekly active users. I’ve developed a custom Siamese Network to detect similarity patterns in over 3 million data points and implemented a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that improved anomaly detection. My approach in a data science project is to understand the end-user and customer first and get clarity about the data.\n\nCollaboration energizes me, especially when working in cross-functional teams. I enjoy being the bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders.. I’m not afraid to take the lead and responsibility when needed.\n\nOutside of work, I’m passionate about football—whether playing, watching, or analyzing it. To clear my mind, I enjoy cycling or running in the summer, and skiing or ice skating in the winter. Furthermore I’m learning both Swedish and Spanish as additional languages. I keep up with the latest developments in data and AI by reading newsletters and visiting tech websites in the evenings.\n\nMy dream is to eventually combine my passion for data and AI with football. Inspired by the Moneyball principle, I hope to one day be part of a team that uses data to drive decisions and performance in the sport.",

    "about": "Sometimes the compiler is the enemy, but I don’t know what I would have done otherwise. \n\nI have always aspired to create a product of my own, one that I’ve developed from scratch and that provides genuine value. To do this, I first want to gain experience by working at great companies and understand the market of today. \n\nFrom making asteroid fighters in assembly to divide-and-conquer algorithms, I have loved university. My niche quickly became the backend part as I have always been drawn to these very logical aspects of the program. The compiler seemed to always be right and soon I learned to trust it. Now, I am so grateful for the field of coding, as it aligns perfectly with my skills and interests. \n\nToday I am looking for jobs in back-end development. I enjoy all parts of coding and especially in logically intense ones. I have found C# and the .NET framework most interesting. Soon, I want to be able to lead my own team where we develop the future. \n\nI am open to opportunities both within and outside of Sweden! Please send me a message on LinkedIn!",

    "about": "Gamer 4 Life!\nFrom an early age i've had a strong interest in technology and digital, interactive systems.\nThis interest led me onto the path of programming and game development during gymnasium, and later during college i found an interest in AI and procedural generation. Shortly after college i also discovered an interest in programming backend systems, and i've come to love to experiment with and implement interesting game mechanics, algorithms, AI, and backend systems for web projects.\nWhen it comes to game mechanics in particular, the more reality-challenging the better!\n\nWorking on a project together with passionate people and being able to contribute to realizing a digital, interactive system is something i find great joy in, and i always make sure to bring my \"A-game\" to every team and task i get to take on. Software development and playing games are the two foremost aspects of life where i feel i'm in my element.\n\nThe following are some of the software and programming languages i've interacted with and learned during the years:\n* AI and procedural generation techniques:\n\t* Finite State Machine, Minimax, Steeringbehaviors, L-Systems, Marching Cubes, A* pathfinding, various sorting algorithms, and various dungeon/labyrinth generation algorithms.\n* Unity and C#\n* Unreal Engine and C++\n* ASP.NET Core and SQL\n* Node, ReactJS, and Javascript/Typescript.\n\nMy biggest accomplishments so far include being awarded the diploma for \"Programmer of the Year\" when i matriculated from gymnasium, the fact that i've acquired a bachelor's degree as well as having been a part of developing a horror game called \"Forgive Me\" during a college project which became decently popular.\n\nI always look forward to being a part of and contributing to a new software project. Right now i'm in-between studies and work and i'm actively exploring the world of software development on my own with various private projects. If i seem like an interesting guy, don't hesitate to send me a message or email!",

För mig är det viktigt att förstå hur någonting fungerar under ytan.\n\nMest är jag intresserad av backend-utveckling där jag får vara nära databaser och datastrukturer, men jag tycker om att lära mig nya saker så jag är öppen för det mesta.

Most recently I worked at Spotify for 12+ years where I helped design, build, run, and maintain large-scale backend/cloud systems as well as desktop and mobile client infrastructure for half a billion users.\n\nI have a tremendous passion for software engineering and worked with many languages and systems throughout my career, such as C/C++, Python, Java, C#, Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix, etc. I love solving complex problems, algorithms, game development, building large-scale backend systems that run fast and reliably, and product development & design.\n\nIn my 12+ years at Spotify I had many different roles:\n\n- As a Backend Engineer I helped architect, build and maintain many mission critical large-scale backend systems for half a billion+ users across the world.\n\n- As a C++/Core Engineer I worked on adding new features to and improving the low level mobile infrastructure used by both iOS and Android apps.\n\n- As a Staff Engineer/tech lead I helped set up the tech steering/strategy group for the Core Experience team at Spotify and worked on architecting and drive large tech investments and projects.\n\n- As a Product Manager I developed, researched, launched and maintained many prominent features to hundreds of millions of users all over the world for the Core Experience team at Spotify.\n\nMy spare time is dedicated to my many hobbies such as game development, music, drawing and art, beach volleyball, photography, and travel.",

I tried my best to put effort in visual hierarchy and to have the UI & UX on point.The client had an outdated wordpress website and their own domain, so the focus was to upgrade the website and move the domain over to my Vercel hosted project. So i needed to learn everything i could about DNS settings in a very short period of time.I used ReactJS and integrated Wondr (a service they use for schedule, booking and memberships) and EmailJS for a simple contact. I got to be included in the photoshoots as well and have my input on what would work well on the website, so my curios marketing eye got a good test as well.Challenging for me to integrate services i have not used before and i had never used a user owned domain that i had to move and change/update the DNS. But overall a very fun project that i learned a lot from.",

    "about": "I have a Bachelor degree in audio engineering. It has over the years taken me throughout a few countries where I have practiced my skills and learnt a bunch more. The profession have given me a lot of fantastic experience through the years but also made me a lot of new friends. \n\nI have really liked the technical part of the job but also that you always are in close contact and have collaboration with other people all the time.\n\nThat’s why I now have taken the step towards a career in Front end Development. I think it will broaden my technical skills quite a bit but also the communicative part as well. \nI think I have a lot of experience from my work over the last decade as a audio engineer that will serve me well in the future as I progress as a developer and I look with excitement for what the future will bring!",

Blev glatt överraskad över hur kreativt programmering är. Jag älskar kombinationen av problemlösning och design.\nHTML, CSS, Javascript och Typescript är självklara kunskaper jag har som frontendutvecklare. React och jag har följts åt sedan utbildningen via lite olika ramverk, men Vue var ju inte så dumt det heller. \nJag är av naturen nyfiken och tycker om att lära nytt och behärska det jag håller på med för att sedan doppa tån i nya tekniker. \n\nI ett varmt och inkluderande arbetsklimat med en arbetskultur som främjar kunskapsdelning är där jag trivs och utvecklas bäst. Man tar sig snabbast framåt tillsammans. \n\nJag är högst förtjust i att tälta i skogen och vandra på fjället. För att utmana mina egna rädslor och få lite muskler klättrar jag på inomhus på klättergym. Jag är även hundägare vilket innebär vettiga skor, bajspåsar och hundgodis i varenda jackficka, tre olika sorters regnjackor och möjlighet att erbjuda gullig liten kontorshund som varken dreglar eller fäller.\nResten av tiden går åt till tv-spel och scifi-filmer. Och klura på roliga kodprojekt.\n\nConnecta gärna!\n🖖",

    "about": "Hi! \nMy name is Linnéa Ajger. I’m a frontend developer with a background as a physiotherapist. I truly love solving problems and I found a new passion in programming. It makes me happy to create clean code with a good structure, and then get direct feedback seeing the result in the browser. I really enjoy the styling part and my aim is to create beautiful things where pixel matters.\n\n As a physio I’ve developed great communication and social skills. It’s a job about meeting people and find a way to collaborate together with the patient but also with colleagues. But I missed something in my previous work, the stimulation from solving a tricky puzzle and to have my power of change in my own hands.\n\nI’m intrigued by the fact that as a developer you’re never done learning. There’s always new things to learn and it’s important to keep up with the industry. I’m a fast learner and I feel very satisfied with myself when I learn new things.\n\nWho am I as a person then? \nI’m the one who loves helping others. I’m the one who is seeing more solutions than problems. I’m usually the one who smiles a lot and likes to joke around, but also have a good sense of when to be professional. I like doing activities outdoors or lifting heavy things with my fellow crossfitters. I also recently took a pottery class and that’s something I’d love to explore more! \n\n⭐️ Tech favourites: CSS, React, JavaScript, HTML",

      "James Armer “Petra joined the Secure Privacy team for an internship and was tasked with improving an existing product which had become less popular. She immediately threw herself into the task at hand, completing detailed competitor research and producing high quality internal documentation. Despite not having prior Angular experience, she was able to pick up the framework easily and began implementing the improvements she had designed herself. Throughout this process she was always eager to learn new technologies for the project and worked independently, demonstrating resourcefulness which worked well in our startup environment. She would be a great addition to any team as a frontend engineer and beyond.”",

She is calm and patient, accountable and helping, yet passionate in taking herself into new challenges. Wishing you all the best in your future career path, Petra!”"

Man hittar mig också framför datorn där jag gärna bygger på mina sidoprojekt, jag hänger också en del på gymmet. \n\nPå en arbetsplats trivs jag bäst i ett team där alla får möjlighet att uttrycka sina åsikter och idéer. Jag kan också bidra med mina kunskaper att bygga användarvänliga, skalbara och responsiva webb- och mobilapplikationer där mina favoritramverk är React, Vue.js och React Native :)",

      "Daniel Toll “Jag rekommenderar Shirin eftersom hon varit en av de hårdast arbetande studenterna som jag sett under min tid på Linneuniversitetet. Med mig har hon läst Mjukvarukvalitet, testning och (läser nu) examensarbete med goda resultat. Hon är skicklig i programmering (JavaScript, C#, Java och flera ramverk), Hon har stor erfarenhet av att programmera mot APIer och mot AI (LLM, GPT-4). Shirin är mycket tekniskt intresserad och skaffar sig ett djup i kunskaperna. Hon vill förstå på djupet men är också pragmatisk och kan leverera när det krävs. Shirin är välorganiserad, planerar sin tid för att nå sina mål. Hon samarbetar väl med andra studenter och skapar en trivsam miljö runt sig.”",
      "Johan Leitet “Throughout her second and third year at Linnaeus University, Shirin effectively balanced her studies with a part-time teaching assistant position in introductory programming and web development courses. She consistently demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility in her role, making her a colleague I would gladly work with again.”"

Jag är också en pålitlig lagspelare som alltid bidrar till mitt team med både soft- och hardskills.\n\nJag brinner för problemlösning och har ett skarpt öga för detaljer, därtill har jag ett positivt mindset och är lätt att kommunicera med.\n\nMin naturliga fallenhet för service vässar jag ytterligare i min nuvarande tjänst som deltidsmedarbetare på Coop. Då jag är både engagerad och ansvarsfull har jag blivit tilldelad ansvar för kolonial, chark samt den färgglada sektionen frukt och grönt. Tidigare har jag även arbetat på Filmstaden, Friends arena, restauranger och festivaler. Att kunna ta med sig erfarenheter från olika branscher och tjänster berikar min kreativitet och konsultmässighet. Jag är stresstålig över normen och tar med glädje emot de utmaningar jag ställs inför. \n\nPå fritiden fortsätter jag utveckla mina färdigheter inom kodning genom egna projekt, tex. att skapa hemsidor, samt satsar hårt på min träning med en sidokarriär i boxning.",

        "description": "Under min praktik (10 veckor) på Skolverket fick jag möjlighet att delta i ett spännande projekt där jag utvecklade en applikation för att jämföra gymnasieskolor. Projektet gav mig praktisk erfarenhet i flera moderna teknologier och arbetsmetoder, vilket gjorde praktiken både givande och lärorik. En del av arbetet innefattade att använda Sitevision och Gitlab för versionshantering och samarbete i projektet. Jag använde också React-ramverket med Typescript för att utveckla applikationens gränssnitt, där jag skapade komponenter och implementerade funktionalitet samt använde jag mig av Jest för enhetstester för att säkerställa att alla komponenter fungerar som de ska. För att säkerställ en professionell och användarvänlig design använde jag SCSS för att styla komponenterna och skapa en responsiv layout.Under denna period lärde jag mig mycket om hur det är att arbeta som utvecklare i ett team. Jag fick förståelse för hur varje del av projektet är beroende av varandra, och hur viktigt det är att kunna samarbeta effektivt. Genom att använda Jira som ett verktyg för sprintplanering och ärendehantering, fick jag praktiskt erfarenhet av hur man planerar, organiserar och prioriterar arbetsuppgifter. Jag lärde mig också hur man skapar och hanterar tickets i Jira för att hålla koll på framstegen och säkerställa att projektet går framåt enligt tidsplanen. Denna praktik har inte bara stärkt mina tekniska färdigheter inom utveckling och design, utan även gett mig värdefull insikt i hur det dagliga arbetet fungerar i ett professionellt utvecklingsteam, där kommunikation och samarbete är centrala för framgång.",

Han är imponerande effektiv och fokuserad och sätter värde på att leverera med kvalitet till användare för snabb feedback. Att vara så produktiv i kombination med finurlig humor och rak och tydlig kommunikation gör honom till en oerhört omtyckt och värdefull lagspelare.”"

Priyam possesses an exceptional blend of technical expertise, leadership skills, and dedication to excellence.

Her proactive approach to problem-solving and willingness to mentor junior team members greatly contributed to the overall success of our projects. In addition to her leadership qualities, Priyam is an outstanding developer. She has a deep understanding of various programming languages and technologies, and her attention to detail is unparalleled. She consistently delivered high-quality code and was always willing to share her knowledge and expertise with others. Moreover, Priyam is a pleasure to work with.Her positive attitude, strong work ethic, and ability to collaborate effectively make her a valuable asset to any team.”",
      "Ajay Shenoy “Priyam worked with me in two different assignments in Amdocs. In the first, I had recently moved to lead the unit where she was working as a Team Lead. As a Team Lead, Priyam was very strong with SAFe processes and had a very good command on the functionality in the project. Her leadership and collaboration with the other Scrum teams made her stand out as an outstanding Scrum master. The second instance was in a completely different team where we were looking for a strong leader to manage the team and project. I immediately thought of Priyam and had her join this project. Once again, Priyam did a splendid job. The team always looked up to her for her leadership and mentoring. Its been a great pleasure to work with her and she will be an asset in any organization she is a part of.”"

I am the designer and developer of some of them and participated as a developer in others. Most of my experience is in digital asset management and broadcasting sector but I have also experience in MRP, ERP and integration applications as a developer and consultant.\n\nI like both learning new things and teaching. I have already arranged in-house training sessions in the past on various software development related topics including memory management, performance optimizations, design patterns, software architectures, dependency injection, coding standards, NoSQL... I also have a few courses hosted on Udemy platform.\n\nI am currently studying Python and machine learning concepts from tinyML applications to LLMs, trying to improve both my academic and practical knowledge on the field.",
